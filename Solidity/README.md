# Applications:
## inbox
Covered basics of solidity such as prototyping in Remix, Compiling with solc, interacting with web3 and deploying to test nodes with truffle. 

## lottery
A manager would start a lottery, other people would contribute ether to the contract, and then when the manager closes the lotto, a random player would win the contract's balance. 

Covered random numbers in solidity and how contracts can be manipulated by troublesome addresses. Deployed to the rinkeby chain via truffle and infura.

Bootstrapped a react app with Create React App to interact with the contract via web3 and metamask.

## campaign
The largest by far of the demo applications. This covered creating a full fledged DAPP similar to Kickstarter. Managers send a request to a contract with a minimum contribution amount which would inturn create a campaign contract. Users contribute to the campaign and then the campaign manager is able to create spending requests which the contributers would have to approve. It's a mouthful, but think Kickstarter and it will make sense. 

Using one contract to manage and create multiple children contracts. 

A full blown next.js server side rendering react app with dynamic routing to interact with the campaign contract 


### CryptoZombies
Link - https://cryptozombies.io/

Tutorial going through the stages of creating a multi contract solidity DAPP and interacting with external DAPPS. Featured creating an ERC721 token creation, standards, and conforming to public interfaces, such as those found on OpenZeppelin.com.


### HelperContracts
Contracts used in the UdemyCourseWork as well as in CryptoZombies. There are some file path errors in the projects just b/c of how I moved files around when sourcing them.
