# Introduction
This repo contains code produced from multiple tutorials, online courses, and walkthroughs. Nothing within this repo is original, this is just sourcing my travels through the blockchain; from representing the bare minimums of a blockchain with a python array to recognizing and exploiting security holes in ethereum contracts, this repo has it all.

# Python
### My First Blockchain
Tutorial Link : https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46

Created a trivial private Python blockchain complete with the ability to mine new blocks, consensus transaction control, and api endpoint mappings via Flask. 


# Solidity
## Udemy Course Work

* Code for the courses are found in the Solidity folder

### Course 1 - Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide

https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/overview

Created multiple solidity and react applications.

### Course 2 - Pass the Certified Blockchain Developer Exam - ETHEREUM

https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-blockchain-certification/learn/v4/overview

Covered basics of the blockchain all the way to more complex topic such as security, consensus algorithms, and then finally coding in solidity.

### Course 3 - Ethereum Blockchain Developer: Build Projects Using Solidity

https://www.udemy.com/blockchain-developer/learn/v4/

Covered setting up and interacting with a private ethereum blockchain using geth. Went into debth on how smart contracts work at their lowest level, and deployed smart contracts to our private blockchain with Truffle

First bit of work I did on my own. Analyzing contracts and finding weaknesses in them. I am not posting the contracts/code for this one, but describing below the fault in the contracts and what I did to exploit them.
