# Introduction
This repo contains code produced from multiple tutorials, online courses, and walkthroughs. Nothing within this repo is original, this is just sourcing my travels through the blockchain; from representing the bare minimums of a blockchain with a python array to recognizing and exploiting security holes in ethereum contracts, this repo has it all.

# Python
### My First Blockchain
Tutorial Link : https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46

Created a trivial private Python blockchain complete with the ability to mine new blocks, consensus transaction control, and api endpoint mappings via Flask. 

#PrivateEthereumBlockchain
Private ethereum blockchain created using the geth commandline. View the readme within that project for more information. 

# Solidity
### Udemy Course Work
Course 1 - Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide

https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/overview

Created multiple solidity and react applications. More info below.


Course 2 - Pass the Certified Blockchain Developer Exam - ETHEREUM

https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-blockchain-certification/learn/v4/overview

Covered basics of the blockchain all the way to more complex topic such as security, consensus algorithms, and then finally coding in solidity. (currently 25%+ through this course)


### CryptoZombies
Link - https://cryptozombies.io/

Tutorial going through the stages of creating a solidity contract and interacting with external DAPPS. Featured creating an ERC721 token creation, standards, and conforming to public interfaces, such as those found on OpenZeppelin.com.


### HelperContracts
Contracts used in the UdemyCourseWork as well as in CryptoZombies. There are some file path errors in the projects just b/c of how I moved files around when sourcing them.

# ZEthernaut CTF

First bit of work I did on my own. Analyzing contracts and finding weaknesses in them. I am not posting the contracts/code for this one, but describing below the fault in the contracts and what I did to exploit them.
